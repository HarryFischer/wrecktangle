  - question: Our Solution
    answer-text: "With the tourism landscape dramatically changing over the past few
      years, Trinity College realised they need to adapt along with it. This meant
      diversifying what they offered to their visitors and building a more sustainable
      model for tourism on campus.\n\nWe came up with a strategy that told all the
      unique elements and experiences Trinity has to offer, from zoology to anatomy
      and architecture to biodiversity, so they could attract a wider range of visitors.
      We developed a range of guided and self-guided tours under the Visit Trinity
      umbrella that uncovered hidden gems and standout tales of the campus.\n\nOur
      aim was to reinvent the tourism business model for Trinity by developing existing
      products and creating new experiences to encourage tourists and visitors to
      explore \n and its campus."

    answer-text: |-
      > Wrecktangle recognised the importance of developing products to motivate visitors to explore more of Trinity’s Campus and engage them in new and meaningful ways. Their expertise at navigating the multi-dimensional stakeholder landscape in Trinity was incredibly important to the success of this project and it is fantastic to see its commercial impact since its launch.
