  - question: The Answer
    answer-text: "Driven by the prolonged impacts of Covid and lingering social distancing
      requirements, Trinity College were looking to develop  a quality, low-touch,
      innovative and engaging self-guided tour option for visitors. Along with Trinity’s
      procurement team, Wrecktangle devised a tender for a Visit Trinity app, which
      was awarded to Digisoft TV.\n\nWrecktangle collaborated with Trinity content
      contributors, stakeholders and Digisoft TV to create an innovative self-guided
      tour of the campus, using augmented reality and virtual tours of the incredible
      spaces that can be found at Trinity College. On top of this, we also helped
      lead on delivering Trinity’s first open Visitor Wifi platform, devising specifications
      along with TCD Procurement and IT Services.\n \nWe also wanted to focus on the
      wider commercial value-add of the app, by including wayfinding, catering, retail
      and accommodation information and upselling opportunities, and integrating beacon
      technology to allow targeted information to be sent to visitors as they take
      the tour on Trinity’s Campus."
