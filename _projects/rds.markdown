    answer-text: "Coming out of the pandemic in Summer 2021, RDS were looking to maximise
      its commercial returns for the remainder of 2021.\n\nWrecktangle came on board
      to promote and drive strategic ideation sessions on how the campus could be
      used to drive more footfall, outside of its remit as a ticketed event and conference
      site.\n\nWe collaborated with the executive team and delivered a strategy around
      outdoor summer dining and events for RDS members and other visitors. These ideas
      then also contributed to scoping the Catering Tender for the RDS, where we also
      served on the evaluation team. "

      ​“Wrecktangle’s intervention sparked discussion and drove more strategic thinking across our RDS team to use the Campus in different ways, to increase the footfall to the RDS, outside of those attending our rostered events, and to drive more revenue in quieter periods.”
