The tourism landscape across the world changed dramatically in 2020, and no less so in Trinity College. It became apparent that Trinity needed to diversify its product offer to appeal to a wider customer base and to build a sustainable model for Tourism on the Campus.

wrectangle are tasked with re-imagining what is on offer for visitors on Trinityâ€™s historic campus. We have devised a strategy to combine all the unique elements and experiences Trinity has to offer, to attract different types of visitors and to sustainably increase the economic benefits of tourism to Trinity. This project is not about overburdening the Campus, instead it is about reinventing the Tourism Business Model for Trinity, by developing existing products and creating new experiences to motivate tourists and visitors to come to Trinity and explore the whole of the Campus.

"2020 brought acute challenges to the tourism model in Trinity. wrecktangle devised a strategy to develop products that would deliver sustainable, incremental revenue growth"

Acting Commercial Director, Trinity College Dublin
