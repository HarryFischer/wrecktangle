  - question: The Answer
    answer-text: "With the tourism landscape dramatically changing over the past few
      years, Trinity College realised they need to adapt along with it. This meant
      diversifying what they offered to their visitors and building a more sustainable
      model for tourism on campus. \nWe came up with a strategy that told all the
      unique elements and experiences Trinity has to offer, from zoology to anatomy
      and architecture to biodiversity, so they could attract a wider range of visitors.
      We developed a range of guided and self-guided tours under the Visit Trinity
      umbrella that uncovered hidden gems and standout tales of the campus. \nOur
      aim was to reinvent the tourism business model for Trinity by developing existing
      products and creating new experiences to encourage tourists and visitors to
      explore Trinity and its campus. "
