  - question: Our Solution
    answer-text: "Alongside the Abbey Theatre’s compelling theatrical programme, they
      also offer ancillary products to customers, including Food & Beverage, Theatre
      Skills for Business, Events and Venue Hire, Tours, and Membership. \n\nThis
      project aimed to meaningfully interrogate and integrate the commercial potential
      of the ancillary revenue streams within the overall Abbey Theatre Strategy,
      and to ensure the ambition was matched by the operational infrastructure. \n\nWrecktangle
      assessed and made strategic commercial and operational recommendations across
      Planning, Process, Product Offer, Prioritisation and Promotion. We captured
      insights and information from key stakeholders, employees, competitors, and
      potential customers of the Abbey Theatre, alongside gathering and analysing
      information and data related to ancillary revenues in theatres. \n"
