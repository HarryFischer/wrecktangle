  - question: Our Solution
    answer-text: "In assessing Value for Money, it was critical Wrecktangle captured
      insights and information from Stakeholders, Event Partners and Potential Attendees
      of FÉILTE, alongside gathering and analysing information and data related to
      the event. \n\nThis took the form of qualitative analysis: interviews, structured
      one-to-one sessions, surveying 106,000 registered members on the Register of
      Teachers; and quantitative analysis: attendee data, debriefs, post event surveys,
      financial reviews, and benchmarking.  \n \nWrecktangle identified and developed
      relevant themes across Purpose, Communication, Event Impact, Barriers and Financial
      & Governance and made observations and recommendations based on our findings,
      to ascertain value for money and ensure the best outcomes for future events.\n"

  - question: 'The Reaction '
    answer-text: "> It was a pleasure working with Wrecktangle on the review. They
      brought a vigour and expertise to the audit, whilst at the same time never losing
      sight of the overall purpose of the event. Their survey findings and financial
      insights are invaluable to us, as we continue to promote and grow FÉILTE.\n\nPhil
      Fox, Deputy Director, The Teaching Council, Ireland \n"
