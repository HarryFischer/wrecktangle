  - question: The Our Solution
    answer-text: "The Theatre of Light’s exhibition, Van Gogh Dublin at the RDS, was
      the first Immersive Digital Art destination in Ireland. Unlike traditional museum
      experiences, Theatre Of Light uses a blend of new technologies and media with
      traditional storytelling and design which completely elevates the visitor experience.\n
      \nWrecktangle partnered with the founders as Project Consultants, to devise
      their start up business plan, develop the operating model, determine their strategic
      focus, marketing strategy and to support the delivery of public and private
      project fundraising.\n\nThis included launching Van Gogh Dublin at the RDS in
      May 2022 for its summer exhibition and business modelling for further pop ups
      and permanent locations."
