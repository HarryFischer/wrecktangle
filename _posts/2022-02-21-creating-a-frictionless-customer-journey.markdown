The current focus for the Hospitality, Tourism and Events industry is to motivate visitors to their venues, their attractions and their leisure locations. 

The routes to engaging with these experiences has changed and businesses need to focus on delivering a smooth, consistent visitor experience to their customers. 

Many venues and attractions may have gone online for the first time to offer ticketing, both in order to manage capacity and also in many cases, to introduce timed entry. 

## Old style ticketing approaches are changing in 2021

Other locations, such as hotels and restaurants, will have to capture enhanced customer details and also share information regarding their approach to managing Tourism and Events at this time. 

It is important that these additional elements have been integrated seamlessly into the overall customer journey for your visitors. 

At wrecktangle, we are encouraging businesses to focus on the following five elements:

### Customer journey mapping

Understanding how your customers interact with your experience will lead to key insights. For example, touchpoints that existed in 2019 may no longer be possible, or in 2021 additional steps have been added to the journey, be that online or in person.

### Create signature experiences

Get to know what your brand or experience is best known for. What are your USPs, and why do people want to interact with you? Interweave these unique elements into all aspects of the customer journey to create your own signature experience. 

### Expand your customer base 

Building on your cohesive customer journey and signature experiences, think creatively about how you can appeal to a broader demographic. Tap into current zeitgeists or motivating factors and offer an appealing product to that market. 

### Affiliation Selling

Think about how you can engage your customers in a longer-term relationship with you. Offer opportunities for cross-selling and upselling to add value and enhance the customer experience. 

Focusing on the quality of the relationship rather than the quantity of relationships will provide a more sustainable model into the future. 

### Timely and Relevant Customer Communication

Telling your visitors why you have made changes; how you are keeping them and your staff safe; how you are enhancing their overall experience is important. Your visitors will appreciate the assurances that you are taking capacity management, cleanliness and the safety of everyone seriously. 

However keep communications succinct and relevant to their needs. 

Focus on the above and you are building a sustainable platform for future customer engagement, whilst expanding your experience portfolio and customer demographics.
