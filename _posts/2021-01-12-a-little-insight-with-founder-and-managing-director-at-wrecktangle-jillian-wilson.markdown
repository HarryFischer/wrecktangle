Jillian has always been a strategic thinker, on the lookout for opportunities and coming up with solutions to realise them. She loves breaking down an issue, or untangling a problem, in order to clear the path to focus on what’s next.

When Jillian wanted to set up her business, it was during a global pandemic. She recognised that businesses would need strategic support to navigate the very different and challenging landscape they suddenly find themselves in.

What wrecktangle brings is a solutions-focused approach. Understanding what it takes to develop a business and put in place the building blocks to bring it from conception to operational reality is our specialty.

> Wrecktangle brings your ideas to life – building amazing experiences from concept to activation.

Jillian's career has not been a linear one. She graduated in Law at Trinity, but instead pursued roles in Film, Arts Management and Music Education before starting her love affair with Commercial Operations and Venue Management.

In 2019, she graduated with a First Class Honours in Organisational Development and Transformation from the Irish Management Institute, deepening further her interest and expertise in delivering transformative projects successfully.

> Jillian is a people person. She's energetic, enthusiastic and passionate and always calm in a crisis. 

She is equally comfortable developing concepts and ideas at start up stages as she is re-imagining existing operations. 

Her mantra is - "find the nugget" - the key to unlocking the potential, or untangling the thorny issue. 

> My ambition for wrecktangle is to create success stories across Tourism, the Arts and Culture, Education and Events, starting with exceptional customer experiences and supported by a first-class operational model.
